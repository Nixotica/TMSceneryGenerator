/**
 * The purpose of this test is to provide proof-of-concept for the basics of WFC algorithm.
 * 
 * This test will achieve a few things:
 * - Define the difference between an empty space (ungenerated) and air block (generated)
 * - The ability to randomly select a block in the map (must be platform or verified air block)
 * - Build off from that selected block using a probabilistic generation function
 * - Provide insight as to the average density and for how long this algorithm would run without halting
